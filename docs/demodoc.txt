## Head 2

Bla bla bla ...

- code in list

        //:go
        func main() {
            key := brute(os.Args[1], os.Args[2], 5)
            fmt.Printf("Key is %s\n", key)
        }

    Go language bla bla bla ...
    bla bla bla ...

- Another list item

    You can write several lines in adjacent way, they will be rendered into
    one line!
    bla bla bla ...

    - A very very very very long long nested list title, you can break it in
      multiple lines but rendered in one line...

    - A nested list title

        The nested list content

        Even more lines ...

        You can split thme in space line!

A normal code `hightlight`

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
        printf("%s\n", "hello world");
    }
